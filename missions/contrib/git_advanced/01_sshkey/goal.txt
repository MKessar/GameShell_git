Mission goal
============

Providing the token and your userid every time you make a full synchronisation is irritating and annoying.

Instead of cloning a repository with https, you can do it with an ssh key.



The exact procedure for this might defer from one server provider to another.

Github's documentation can walk you throught this.



Useful commands
===============

you can either :
-remove your current TrainingSpell folder in the Portal room and clone it again using ssh.
-change the status of your local folder from https to ssh authentification.

New clone with ssh:
git clone git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git ./ProUser



Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH
