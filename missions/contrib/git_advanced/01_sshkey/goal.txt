Mission goal
============

According to the Head of the Magic Concil, some spellbooks have been altered in the past, due to avoidable mistakes. 

The Head of the magic council has then sent an emmissary to your castle with an urgent request: all spells created from now on should be put on the SpellBook library (Github, gitlab...) and older ones sitting in Libraries also.

When you arrived as a wizzard in your current Castle, the previous wizzard left a few spells he was working on, without synchronizing them with the SpellBook Library

Saving the spell of the previous wizzard without the need of creating a spell yourself is a good training.



The first step as a wizard is to craft your pair of rings (public and private ssh keys) that will allow you to authenticate without login/password to the remote repository.

1. Create your pair of rings (ssh key)
2. Upload it on your account on the interdimensional library (the remote repository git.univ-pau.fr).

Some instructions on how to create an ssh key:

NB: in our case, we will let the passphrase empty, so no need to setup the ssh agent
