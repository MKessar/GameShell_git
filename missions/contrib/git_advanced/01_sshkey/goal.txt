Mission goal
============

Providing your token/password and your userid every time you make a full synchronisation is irritating and annoying.

Instead of cloning a repository with https, you can do it with an ssh key.



The exact procedure for this might defer from one server provider to another.

Github's documentation can walk you through this.



Useful commands
===============

firefox https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

Then you can either :
-remove your current TrainingSpells folder in the Portal room and clone it again using ssh.
-change the status of your local folder from https to ssh authentification.


New clone with ssh:
git clone git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git 


Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH, from your local folder (TrainingSpells for instance) type:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
