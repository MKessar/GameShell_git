Mission goal
============

You just removed the file spell of truth.

When they saw your lastest commit, the previous wizzard of your castle was greatly confused.

They just send you a message with a instant magic pigeon:

"It took a lot of work to get this spell working properly. Please revert what you just did."


Useful commands
===============

git revert HEAD~0 : revert the modifications of the previous commit: it does create a new commit number.

git push
