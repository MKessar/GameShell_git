Mission goal
============

The front page of a SpellBook is important for magicians.

It usually gives informations on the content of the SpellBook, and how to use it.

Edit the front page (README.md), and add a brief description of the first spell.

Then synchronise your spellbook with the library


Useful commands
===============

You can use any text editor:
gedit FILENAME
vi FILENAME
nano FILENAME


when modifying a file you can commit the modification for this file in one go:
git commit -m 'COMMIT_MESSAGE' FILENAME


But staged modifications can work as well, and are usualy a better practice:

git add FILENAME
git commit -m 'COMMIT_MESSAGE'

This allows you to modify multiple files while performing a single commit


git push


NB
===============
You can also use the following commands

git log


git status
