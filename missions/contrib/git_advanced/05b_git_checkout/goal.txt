Mission goal
============


You are familiar with the history of modifications.

Now, you need to go back to the most recent version of your spellbook.

Ask git to update your working directory with this version by specifying the main branch of your spellbook.



Useful commands
===============

git log oneline : will display the list of previous commit


git checkout BRANCH_NAME: will checkout the most recent commit of the branch "BRANCH_NAME"

git branch: display your current branch and the list of available branches.


NB
============

branches will be introduced more properly in the next missions.
