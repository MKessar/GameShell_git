Mission goal
============

Finally add the beer spell into the main version of your spellbook by realising a merge.

You might encounter a conflict on the amplifier. You need some basics on magic to solve this: an amplifier can be used by several spells as long as all the spells are listed in it.

Useful commands
===============

To look at the history of a local repository putting one commit per line (--oneline), showing diverging and converging history (--graph) and all local branches even if they are not part of the history of the commit pointed by HEAD
git log --oneline --graph --branches


To merge a branch. Ensure you are on the branch you want to merge into and then, to merge the branch BRANCH_NAME into it
git merge BRANCH_NAME


## What is a conflict ?
A conflict occurs when git is asked to merge two commits where the same line of the same file is modified in both commits.
In our case, the spell on the power branch has its first line modified and spell on the main branch has also its first line modified.

When a conflict occurs, git modifies the file in the working directoy like this:
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     cheater_spell
     =======
     beer_spell
     >>>>>>> power

Between the <<< and the === the version of the branch pointed by HEAD, so in our case the main branch
Between the === and the >>> the version of beer branch
Git cannot decide which one is the right one, you have to decide if the first version has be kept, the second, a mix of both, yet a third version... 

## How to fix a conflict ?

-   Replace everything between the <<< and the >>> by the correct version
-   git add FILE_NAME
-   git commit
-   Automatic commit message indicating conflict resolution
