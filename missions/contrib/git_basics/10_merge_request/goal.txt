Mission goal
============

The three spells are now merged into the main version of your spell book ! 

Please note that everything happened locally in your spell book, we were completely disconnected from the remote repository. Let us now perform a merge operation on the remote repository and pull back the result on your local spell book.

1. Push the main branch on the remote repository, if not deon already
2. Create a new spell  in your local spell book (find a creative name for the file !)
3. Add it to your spell book on branch called new_spell
4. Push the new_spell branch on the remote repository
5. Open a Merge Request on the web interface of the remote repository
6. Merge it on the web interface
7. Pull the result back locally

Useful commands
===============

To push commits from the current branch to the remote repository

To update your local branch from the remote
