Mission goal
============


Congratulation on getting your first spellbook.

But what is a spell book without a spell ?

For your first synchronisation, we will go through a step by step process.

First, step into your spellbook (change directory)

Grab your favorite pen, and write a spell which gives today's date and the current time when casted.

Then have a look at the synchronisation state of your local book.


Useful commands
===============
You need to create file named "date.sh" in your spellbook, so in the SmallWeels directory. For this, use your favourite text editor. If you do not have one, you can use gedit.
To open a file with an editor
gedit FILE_NAME

To print the current time and day
date

To Run the script SCRIPT_NAME
source SCRIPT_NAME 

To show the the history of the whole repository
git log 

To show the state of your local repository, staging area and working directory
git status 

To show the difference between your working directory and the laste version in the repository (in 99% of the time, to be precise the comparison is made with the version pointed by HEAD)
git diff

NB
===============

Do not add, commit or push the new file.
