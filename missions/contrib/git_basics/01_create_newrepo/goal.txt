Mission goal
============

The emmissary needs to leave for an other castle, and gives you a few intructions from the magic council to learn the rest by yourself. 


According to the Head of the Magic Concil, some spellbooks have been altered in the past, due to avoidable mistakes. 


When you arrived as a wizzard in your current Castle, the previous wizzard left a few spells he was working on, without synchronizing them with the SpellBook Library(Github; gitlab...).

Saving the spell of the previous wizzard without the need of creating a spell yourself is a good training.


You will start by creating a spellbook(repository) on at the interdimensional library(github)



Useful commands
===============


You need to create a repository on github for training purpose only.

call it "TrainingSpells"

On creation you can create a "README" file. We suggest you to do that

Go to the Portal and clone your repository there


git clone https://github.com/MyLogin/TrainingSpells.git



Remarks
===============

you might need to create a token for github at that stage, github's documentation explains this.
