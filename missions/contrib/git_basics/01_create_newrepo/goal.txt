Mission goal
============

According to the Head of the Magic Concil, some spellbooks have been altered in the past, due to avoidable mistakes. 

The Head of the magic council has then sent an emmissary to your castle with an urgent request: all spells created from now on should be put on the SpellBook library (Github, gitlab...) and older ones sitting in Libraries also.

When you arrived as a wizzard in your current Castle, the previous wizzard left a few spells he was working on, without synchronizing them with the SpellBook Library

Saving the spell of the previous wizzard without the need of creating a spell yourself is a good training.


You will start by creating a spellbook (repository) on at the interdimensional library (github).

Go to the Portal room and clone your repository there


Useful commands
===============


You need to create a repository on github for training purpose only.

call it "TrainingSpells"

On creation you can create a "README" file. We suggest you to do that

You will also need to unprotect the main branch otherwise some missions will fail later. On the gitlab web interface, Settings => Repository => Protected branches => unprotect main branch

git clone https://github.com/MyLogin/TrainingSpells.git



Remarks
===============

you might need to create a token for github at that stage, github's documentation explains this.
