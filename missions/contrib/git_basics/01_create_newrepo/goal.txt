Mission goal
============


Equiped with your rings, now:
1. Create a spellbook (repository) on the interdimensional library (git.univ-pau.fr).
2. Go to the Portal room of the Castle and clone your repository there


Useful commands
===============

call it "spellbook"

On creation of the repository, it is suggested to create a generic "README" file.

You will also need to unprotect the main branch otherwise some missions will fail later. On the gitlab web interface, Settings => Repository => Protected branches => unprotect main branch

To clone a repository:
git clone REPOSITORY_URL

Two URLs are proposed on the web interface, use the one to clone with SSH.
