Mission goal
============

The emmissary needs to leave for an other castle, and gives you a few intructions from the magic council to lean the rest by yourself. 


According to the Head of the Magic Concil, some spellbooks have been altered in the past, due to avoidable mistakes. 

Hence, before using the magical libraries of the community, the council asks you to practice the development of a a set to spellbooks by yourself.





You need to create a repository on github for training purpose only.

On creation you can create a "README" file. We suggest you to do that


Then clone it into the portal Room of the Castle in a repository called "SmallWeels"


Useful commands
===============

git clone https://github.com/MyLogin/MyTrainingdepository.git ./SmallWeels



Remarks
===============

you will need to create a token for github at that stage, github's documentation explains this.
