Mission goal
============

According to the Head of the Magic Concil, some spellbooks have been altered in the past, due to avoidable mistakes. 

The Head of the magic council has then sent an emmissary to your castle with an urgent request: all spells created from now on should be put on the SpellBook library (Github, gitlab...) and older ones sitting in Libraries also.

When you arrived as a wizzard in your current Castle, the previous wizzard left a few spells he was working on, without synchronizing them with the SpellBook Library

Saving the spell of the previous wizzard without the need of creating a spell yourself is a good training.



The first step as a wizard is to craft your pair of rings (public and private ssh keys) that will allow you to authenticate without login/password to the remote repository. Equiped with your rings, you will be able to create your first spellbook (repository) and clone it locally.

1. Create your pair of rings (ssh key)
2. Upload it on your account on the interdimensional library (the remote repository git.univ-pau.fr).
3. Create a spellbook (repository) on the interdimensional library (git.univ-pau.fr). "spellbook" should be the name of the project.
4. Go to the Portal room of the Castle and clone your repository there



Useful commands
===============

Some instructions on how to create an ssh key:
firefox https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

In our case, we will let the passphrase empty, so no need to setup the ssh agent


On creation of the repository, it is suggested to create a generic "README" file.

You will also need to unprotect the main branch otherwise some missions will fail later. On the gitlab web interface, Settings => Repository => Protected branches => unprotect main branch

To clone a repository:
git clone REPOSITORY_URL

Two URLs are proposed on the web interface, use the one to clone with SSH.
