Mission goal
============

Good, let us move on with yet another spell, the cheater spell that helps students to increase their marks !

Again you are not sure to integrate it directly in the main version of your spellbook, so you will add the spell on a branch called cheater CREATED FROM the main branch.

Caution: without amplifier, the spell only increases the mark by one, so copy the spell file and the amplifier in your spell book (and not the entire directory).

Useful commands
===============

To create a branch:
git branch BRANCH_NAME [TREE_ISH]
TREE_ISH is optional, by default it is HEAD, but one can put here a commit identifier, a branch name, a tag, ..., anything that refers to a commit

To start tracking the file FILENAME or add its modification to the staging area:
git add FILENAME

To create a commit with a COMMIT_MESSAGE as comment for the commit:
git commit -m 'COMMIT_MESSAGE'
