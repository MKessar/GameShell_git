Mission goal
============

Excellent !

Let us do the same process again with the flame spell. This time you are not sure to integrate it directly in the main version of your spellbook, so you will add the spell on a branch called flame.

Useful commands
===============

To create a branch:
git branch BRANCH_NAME [TREE_ISH]
TREE_ISH is optional, by default it is HEAD, but one can put here a commit identifier, a branch name, a tag, ..., anything that refers to a commit

To start tracking the file FILENAME or add its modification to the staging area:
git add FILENAME

To create a commit with a COMMIT_MESSAGE as comment for the commit:
git commit -m 'COMMIT_MESSAGE'

To move HEAD on a branch (and update the working directory accordingly)
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
