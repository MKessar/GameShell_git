Mission goal
============


You realise now that the spellbook is actually a bunch of scrolls poorly tied to each other.

Clearly, the magic council was in a hurry when they wrapped this.

After asking the emmissary about it, they replied that a lot of the spellbooks found in the interdimensional libraires are still under devellopement, and it is quite common to find ongoing projects and even dropped ones.

As a warm up, the emmissary ask you to cast the spell on the Enchanted_Scroll.
