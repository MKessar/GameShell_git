Mission goal
============

Now we have the Al Jeit portal, step into it so you can access the magic. 

Look at all available improvements (branches) and create a local branch for each of them.


Useful commands
===============

List available branches with
git branch -a
The "-a" option means "all" branches, i.e. branches that reflect the branches available on the remote repository on top of the local ones.

The full syntax to create a local branch NEW_BRANCH_NAME that will be connected to the REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME on the remote repository REMOTE is
git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME REMOTE/REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME
This gives full flexibility on naming and can ensure no ambiguity in the command

In simple case (like ours), i.e. when there is a single remote and no name collision between branches 
git checkout REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME
will create a local branch REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME, that will be connected to the remote one
