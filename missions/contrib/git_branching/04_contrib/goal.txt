Mission goal
============

Before merging the improvement of Jilano with the usage of a new rune, the wizard of the castle gives you the advice to switch the pineapple ingredient to something more powerful: goat hair !

Look at the arcane book somewhere in the main tower to learn how to modify the spell. Then create a branch named power, checkout it, implement the modification and create a commit.

TODO:
- improve lore
