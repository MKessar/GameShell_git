Mission goal
============

Before merging the improvement of Merwyn with the usage of a new type of mana, the wizard of the castle gives you the advice to switch the magma mana to something more adequate: fire mana !

You decide to implement this modification straight away before forgetting the advice. Look at the arcane book somewhere in the main tower to learn how to modify the spell. Then create a branch named power, checkout it, implement the modification and create a commit.


Useful commands
===============

Use your favorite text editor (or gedit by default) to implement the required modification in the dragon_killer.spell

To create a branch
git branch BRANCH_NAME

To put switch to a branch, i.e. to make your HEAD pointing at a branch
git checkout BRANCH_NAME

The two actions above of creating a branch and switching to it can be done in a single command
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME


To create a commit please refer to previous mission if you forgot...
