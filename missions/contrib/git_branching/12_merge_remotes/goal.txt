Mission goal
============

Now we have a plan ! Merge the pieces you are in charge of in the spell branch according to the plan and, once done, push your updated spell branch on your fork.


Useful commands
===============

To merge a branch. Ensure you are on the branch you want to merge into and then
git merge BRANCH_NAME

If you end up into a CONFLICT and would like to abort the current merge operation
git merge --abort

To change your HEAD on a branch and update the working directory
git checkout BRANCH_NAME

The full syntax to create a local branch NEW_BRANCH_NAME that will be connected to the REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME on the remote repository REMOTE is
git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME REMOTE/REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME
This gives full flexibility on naming and can ensure no ambiguity in the command

In simple case (like ours), i.e. when there is a single remote and no name collision between branches 
git checkout REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME
will create a local branch REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME, that will be connected to the remote one

Push a branch BRANCH_NAME on the remote REMOTE_NAME
git push REMOTE_NAME BRANCH_NAME
