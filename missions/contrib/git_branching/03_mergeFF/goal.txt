Mission goal
============

We will merge now those improvements (add_rune and new_ingredient) and contribute also ourself to the spell. But one step after the other, let us focus for now on merging the new_ingredient improvement.

Look at the history of the spell, which kind of merge it is ? a fast-forward merge ? or a real merge ?

Look at the current content of the spell, make sure you are on the main branch, realise the merge and verify that the portal did modify the spell.

TODO:
- improve lore
- rename main branch name into spell


Useful commands
===============

To look at the history of a local repository putting one commit per line (--oneline) and showing diverging and converging history (--graph)
git log --oneline --graph


To merge a branch. Ensure you are on the branch you want to merge into and then
git merge BRANCH_NAME
