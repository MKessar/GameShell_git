Mission goal
============

We will merge now those improvements (adding_light and adding_earth) and contribute also ourself to the enchantment. But one step after the other, let us inspect first the history and the content of each branch.

Look at the history of the enchantment:
a. if we want to merge the adding_light branch into spell, which kind of merge it is ? a fast-forward merge ? or a real merge ?
b. if we want to merge the adding_earth branch into spell, which kind of merge it is ? a fast-forward merge ? or a real merge ?

Look at the the enchantment itself (content of file dragon_killer.spell) and its different versions on the different branches:
c. What is the first ingredient of the enchantment on the spell branch
d. What is the first ingredient of the enchantment on the adding_light branch
e. What is the first ingredient of the enchantment on the adding_earth branch

Look at the arcane book somewhere in the main tower to learn about enchantment structure how to modify them. Then create a branch named power, checkout it, implement the modification and create a commit.

Ensure your HEAD is on the spell branch before answering the questions.
