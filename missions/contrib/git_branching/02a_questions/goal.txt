Mission goal
============

We will merge now those improvements (add_rune and new_ingredient) and contribute also ourself to the spell. But one step after the other, let us inspect the history and the content of each branch.

Look at the history of the spell:
a. if we want to merge the new_ingredient branch into main, which kind of merge it is ? a fast-forward merge ? or a real merge ?
b. if we want to merge the add_rune branch into main, which kind of merge it is ? a fast-forward merge ? or a real merge ?

Look at the the spell version on the different branches:
c. What is the first ingredient of the spell on the main branch
d. What is the first ingredient of the spell on the new_ingredient branch
e. What is the first ingredient of the spell on the add_rune branch

Ensure you are on the main branch before answering the questions.

TODO:
- improve lore
- rename main branch name into spell
