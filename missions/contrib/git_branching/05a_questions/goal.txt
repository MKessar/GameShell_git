Mission goal
============

Before merging the last branch, let us inspect again the local repository.

Look at the history of the spell:
a. if we want to merge the power branch into spell, which kind of merge it is ? a fast-forward merge ? or a real merge ?

Look at the the spell version on the different branches. What is the first ingredient of the spell
b. on the spell branch ?
c. on the power branch ?
d. on the most recent common ancestor of spell and power branches ?
e. In this context, if we merge the power branch into the spell branch, will there be a conflict ?

Ensure you are on the spell branch before answering the questions.


Useful commands
===============

To look at the history of a local repository putting one commit per line (--oneline), showing diverging and converging history (--graph) and showing all branches (--branches)
git log --oneline --graph --branches

To display the content of a text file in the terminal
cat FILE_NAME

To put HEAD on anywhere in the repository and update the working directory:
git checkout REF_LOG
REF_LOG can be:
- a branch name
- any commit referenced by its id, for instance 30c900f
- any commit being an ancestor of a branch or HEAD, for instance HEAD^ references the immediate ancestor of HEAD, add_rune^^ references tha ancestor of the ancestor of the commit pointed by add_rune.


What is a conflict ?
A conflict occurs when git is asked to merge two commits where the same line of the same file is modified in both commits compared to their most recent common ancestor.
