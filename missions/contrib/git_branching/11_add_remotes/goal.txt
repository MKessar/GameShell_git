Mission goal
============

Check the updated PortalBook, split the work of gathering all enchantment pieces between you and the other(s) wizards(s) and create a remote for each repository you are in charge of.
Then fetch all necessary repositories and create local branches for each branches that exist remotely.
Ensure you are on the spell branch at the end.

Useful commands
===============

Add a remote to your local repository
git remote add REMOTE_NAME REPOSITORY_URL

Fetch remote repository REMOTE_NAME content locally
git fetch REMOTE_NAME

The full syntax to create a local branch NEW_BRANCH_NAME that will be connected to the REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME on the remote repository REMOTE is
git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME REMOTE/REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME
This gives full flexibility on naming and can ensure no ambiguity in the command

In simple case (like ours), i.e. when there is a single remote and no name collision between branches 
git checkout REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME
will create a local branch REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME, that will be connected to the remote one
