Mission goal
============

Now everything is merged, let us clean the repository and remove all the branches we do need anymore.

Useful commands
===============

To delete a branch that has been merged (our case). 
git branch -d BRANCH_NAME
You will need to use -D instead of -d for a non merged branch. As deleting such a branch might lead to hide some commits in the history, this gives a little bt of security
