Mission goal
============

The magic concil wants to keep a record of any modifications on the library.

They also need to keep track of who has made changes, just for safety reason. That's why they want you to include your identity in your staff.

You neeed to configure your git identity on your computer to be able to perfom "commits" (this term will be defined later).

You Need to be in spellbook to configure your ID.

Useful commands
===============

git config --local user.name "FIRSTNAME LASTNAME"
git config --local user.email ME@EMAIL.FR

NB:

The same commands can be run with `--global` instead of `--local` which is recommended if you have the same identity for all your projects. 
But it will not work inside gameshell, so stick to `--local` please.
