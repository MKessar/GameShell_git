Mission goal
============

The magic concil likes to keep a record of the modifications on the library.

They also need to keep track of whom has made changes, just for safety reason.

You neeed to configure your git identity on your computer to be able to perfom "commits"(this term be defined later).




Useful commands
===============

If you only use one git server:

git config --global user.name ”github_name”
git config --global user.email ”me@email.fr”


If you only use multiple git servers, you can configure a local identidy in a depository:

git config --local user.name ”github_name”
git config --local user.email ”me@email.fr”
