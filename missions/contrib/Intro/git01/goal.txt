Git is a version manager software. This can Help you to share codes, tex files, or even host websites.

Usually, you have acces to a remote server (github or gitlab for instance) where a code is stored.


First, you need to create a new depository called doc_git in the Portals room

then use 

git clone https://github.com/MKessar/learning_git.git ./doc_git

This will create a local copy of the distant repository "learning_git" into .doc_git
