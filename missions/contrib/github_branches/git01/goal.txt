Mission goal
============


Branches are usefull when dealing with multiple project on the same git repository.

If you are trying to implement a new model, or work on the optimisation of your code, you might need a separate branch for those.

in addition, if you have a stable version of your code, and you need to try something sketchy, a develloping branch is critical.

You can merge the modification of a branch into the main branch when you are happy with the modifications.



First, let's create a new branch in the ProUser folder, and send it to the github repo.






Useful commands
===============

git checkout -b dev

#creates a branch called "dev"


git push origin dev

#sends your local branch to the server
