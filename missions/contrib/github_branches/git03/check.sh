# This file is required. It is sourced when checking the goal of the mission

# It should end with a command returning 0 on success, and something else on
# failure.
# It should "unset" any local variable it has created, and any "global
# variable" that were only used for the mission. (The function _mission_check
# is automatically unset.)

# It typically looks like
